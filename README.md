# Sentiment140 Dataset Sentiment Analysis

This project utilizes the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 million tweets labeled with positive or negative sentiment. The goal is to perform sentiment analysis on these tweets to classify them as either positive or negative.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Sentiment140 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140/data), which contains tweet data and sentiment labels. 

- **Sentiment Labels**: 
  - 0: Negative
  - 4: Positive

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow` (or PyTorch), etc.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment140-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140/data).
2. Load the dataset into your Python environment and begin the sentiment analysis process.
3. Run the sentiment classification model to predict whether the tweets are positive or negative.

## Model

In this project, a deep learning model (or machine learning model) is used for sentiment classification. The model is trained on the labeled tweets to learn the patterns that determine sentiment.

## Results

The model's performance will be evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
